# chromatic-signed-webhook-examples

These are example implementations of validating the X-Signed-Webhook header from Chromatic.

Each is organized under the language used, and attempts to use common packages to give a complete example.

## /request

This is a CLI tool written in Go which is capable of making signed requests in the same manner as Chromatic.

By default, you can use it against your example servers with no flags, as the defaults are shared across all exmaple servers.
